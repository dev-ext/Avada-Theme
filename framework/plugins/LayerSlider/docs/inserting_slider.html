<h3>Inserting the slider with shortcode</h3>
<p>
	You can place your sliders into pages and posts with their shortcodes.
	You can find the shortcode for each slider in this page next to their names
	in the list view. To insert the slider, edit a page or post and insert its
	shortcode into the WordPress text editor.
</p>

<h3>Inserting the slider with the LayerSlider WP widget</h3>
<p>
	LayerSlider WP supports widgets, so you can place your slider in your
	front-end page just by a drag n' drop. To do that, navigate to the Appearance
	menu on your left sidebar and select "Widgets". Grab the LayerSlider WP
	Widget and drop it into one of your widget area. <br><br>

	Please note that some themes may not support a widget area what you need.
	In this case, you can create a new widget area by editing your theme files.
	<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgetizing_Themes" target="_blank">Here</a>
	is the official documentation about widgetizing your theme.

<h3>Calling the slider from your theme files</h3>
<p>
	Because a slider can be an integral part of your site, you may want to place it
	into your theme files. There is a PHP function with filtering options which you
	can call for example from the header.php file of your theme and it inserts your slider into your
	home page or certail other pages depending on your filtering settings.
	Here is the function definition:<br><br>

	<strong>layerslider</strong> ( mixed $sliderID [, string $pages] )<br><br>

	The <i>$sliderID</i> parameter can be found on the plugin page in the slider list view at the
	first table column. <br><br>

	The <i>$pages</i> parameter is a comma separated list of pages either by name or the ID of the pages.
	If you are unsure about your page names or IDs, look at their URL, it is the last component.<br><br>

	There is a special page name, the "homepage", with you can filter LayerSlider WP to display the
	slider on your home page. It is also works if you set up a static custom page instead of the default post listing.<br><br>

	The follwing examples are all valid, you can use either of these, you can even mix them on your own needs:<br><br>

	<strong>&lt;?php layerslider(1); ?&gt;</strong> // Displays the first slider on every page<br>
	<strong>&lt;?php layerslider(1, &#39;homepage&#39;); ?&gt;</strong> // Displays the first slider only on your home page<br>
	<strong>&lt;?php layerslider(1, &#39;my-custom-post-title&#39;); ?&gt;</strong> // Displays the first slider on a custom page by name<br>
	<strong>&lt;?php layerslider(2, &#39;1369&#39;); ?&gt;</strong> // Diplays the second slider on a custom page by ID<br>
	<strong>&lt;?php layerslider(3, &#39;homepage,about-us,1234&#39;); ?&gt;</strong> // Displays the third slider on multiple pages<br><br>

	It is important when you want to insert a slider to check its ID on the LayerSlider WP slider list page.
	When you removes some sliders, their IDs won't be reindexed and the sequence may broke up. This is important
	to keep persistent your sliders preventing unwanted changes on the already inserted ones.
