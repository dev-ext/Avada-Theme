<h3>Animation steps</h3>
<div>
	The 3D transitions are made up with 3 steps to offer you a way to create more-complex animations with multiple actions.
	The "animation" step is required, but the "before animation" and "after animation" steps are optional. You can
	use them to do some preparation before the animation starts or restore back some settings after it is done.<br><br>

	To help you understand what are these steps, here is a simple example:
	<ul>
		<li>Before the animation starts, you want to scale down the cubodis</li>
		<li>Then rotate them to left</li>
		<li>Finally, you want them to scale up back</li>
	</ul>

	If you want a really simple transition, you don't have to use all the steps. In this case, please
	make sure to untick the "Enabled" checkboxes for the corresponding steps.
